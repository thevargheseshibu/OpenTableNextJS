# Next.js OpenTable Project

This repository contains the source code for a Next.js course project, covering various topics related to building web applications with Next.js.

## Main Features

- **File Structure and Routing**: Learn how to organize your project's file structure and implement routing in Next.js.

- **Tailwind CSS**: Integration of the Tailwind CSS framework for styling.

- **Server and Client Components**: Understanding and implementing server and client components in Next.js.

- **Frame**:Prisma (ORM),middleware, hashers and json web tokens.

- **Database Integration**: Connect to a Postgres database, define schemas, and seed data.

- **Data Fetching and Rendering**: Fetch and display data from the server using server components.

- **Authentication**: Implement user authentication, including JWT-based authentication.

- **Loading and Error States**: Handle loading, error, and not-found states gracefully.

- **Scheduling and Availability**: Develop scheduling and availability features for your application.

## How to Run the App

Follow these steps to run the Next.js course project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nextjs-course-project.git
   cd nextjs-course-project


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
